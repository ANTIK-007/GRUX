## Introduction

**GRUX** allows you to build and explore your own Local Language Model (LLM) interface, designed for experimentation and customization. Built with modern web technologies, it delivers a scalable and interactive frontend foundation.

---

## Features

- **Modern React UI** with support for TypeScript.
- Clean, responsive styling with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn-ui** components.
- Fast tooling powered by **Vite**.
- Simple local setup for development and prototyping.
- Ready for seamless deployment on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** – lightning-fast build and development tooling.
- **TypeScript** – static typing for scalable codebases.
- **React** – component-based UI architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling for rapid UI development.
- **shadcn-ui** – out-of-the-box polished UI components.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (including npm or bun)—you can manage versions easily using tools like `nvm`

---

## Installation & Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ANTIK-007/GRUX.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd GRUX

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

```

## Using GRUX with a Local or Remote LLM

After completing setup and starting the development server, follow these steps to connect GRUX to a local or remote LLM:

Integrating a Local LLM Model

1. Run Your Local Model Backend
Make sure your model server (such as an open-source LLM running locally on your machine) is up and running, listening for HTTP requests.
Example API endpoint:
http://localhost:8000/api/chat

2. Configure Frontend Connection
Set the backend API endpoint in a config file (such as src/config.js) or in a .env file at the root:
MODEL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/chat

Restart Development Server
After updating your configuration, restart with npm run dev.

Integrating a Remote/API-Based Model

1. Obtain API Endpoint and Credentials
If using a cloud/model provider (OpenAI, HuggingFace), get your API endpoint and secret key.

2. Set Environment Variables
Example for an OpenAI endpoint:
MODEL_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
API_KEY=your-api-key-here

Save and Restart

3. Save your environment or configuration file and restart the server.

## Typical User Workflow
1. Start the development server (npm run dev).

2. Open the app in your browser:
http://localhost:5173

3. Input prompts in the UI.
GRUX will send queries to your configured LLM, and display the responses. Example .env
MODEL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/chat
API_KEY=sk-testkey123

## Contributing Process Flow

Interested in contributing? Here’s a step-by-step guide for enhancing GRUX:

1. Fork the Repository
Click the "Fork" button on GitHub to create your own copy of the project.

2. Clone Your Fork
Use 
```git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GRUX.git``` to copy it locally.

3. Set Up the Project
Follow installation instructions:
```
cd GRUX
npm install
npm run dev
```
Ensure everything runs correctly before making changes.

4. Create a New Branch
Work on a dedicated branch for your feature or bugfix:
```git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name```

5. Make Enhancements
Implement your changes, add features, fix bugs, or improve documentation.

6. Test Your Changes
Run the app and verify your enhancements work and existing functionality remains stable.

7. Commit and Push
Commit changes with clear messages:
```
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin feature-or-fix-name
```

8. Create a Pull Request
Go to the repository on GitHub and open a pull request from your branch to main.

9. Review and Collaborate
Respond to feedback from maintainers. Update your branch if asked.Once approved, your changes will be merged.
